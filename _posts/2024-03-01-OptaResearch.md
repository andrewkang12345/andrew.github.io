## Opta Forum Research

BACKGROUND /

This was presented at the Opta Forum (by Stats Perform), under the advisory of Dr. Scott Powers. It was an extension of my final project for his course, on clustering player styles in soccer, which caught his attention. We brought in recursive clustering and cluster-specific evaluation afterward. This was also presented again at Zelus Analytics.

RESULTS /

Below is a demo video submitted before the presentation on stage.

Player role clustering is a well-known problem in sports analytics, often hindered by a common flaw in many clustering methodologies: the equal weighting of all features, regardless of their relevance to the specific analysis objective.

To identify players from different teams who are stylistically similar on the field to enhance recruitment workflows, Andrew, Travis and Scott’s poster will apply Opta Vision data to present a two-step recursive K-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm first clusters role styles based on a player’s on- and off-ball tendencies and then creates sub-clusters based on the specific requirements of a recruitment analyst, such as applying passing-related features when looking to identify playmakers.

To compare the skill of players in each cluster and assess their contribution to wins, Andrew, Travis and Scott will adapt the Box Plus-Minus (BPM) method used in basketball analytics. This involves using the Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM) to estimate each player’s contribution to their team’s expected goal (xG) differential. By doing so, the analysis will highlight the numeric importance of each skill that different player clusters must excel in, for their team’s success.

Andrew is an undergraduate studying Computer Science at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where he also acts as a data analyst for Rice Athletics’ women’s soccer team, whose backroom team includes Travis as an Assistant Coach. They compete in NCAA Division I. Scott joined Rice University’s Department of Sport Management as an Assistant Professor in Sport Analytics in 2023.
