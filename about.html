    :art:&nbsp;Welcome to my portfolio! I am Andrew Kang, an aspiring researcher
    from Rice University, dedicated to advancing AI-driven Human-Computer
    Interaction and interactive systems.

  <p>
    With a Bachelor's degree in computer science and a passion for
    interdisciplinary research, my work aims to push the boundaries of human-AI
    collaboration. Please explore my journey, projects, and achievements through
    the sections in the top right corner. I envision a future where immersive
    technology not only replicates reality but deeply influences how we perceive
    and respond to it. Inspired by concepts like TeleAbsence and projects like
    Memoro, I aim to integrate brain-computer interfaces and non-invasive brain
    stimulation to enhance hyperrealism. By inducing selective distraction or
    emphasizing key details during low-focus states, we can create tools that
    improve memory retention and emotional immersion. In training environments,
    VR can simulate real-world stress by introducing hyperrealistic noise,
    conditioning users to perform under pressure. My goal is to push the
    boundaries of human-computer interaction, merging neuroscience and immersive
    tech to redefine memory, training, and emotional connections.
